Iris Classification This repository uses the Iris data set from R.A. Fischer's paper 'The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems' &lt;http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris>  Classification algorithms (Logistic Regression and Neural Networks) have been coded from scratch and trained using gradient/scipy.optimize to predict Iris 'species' based on the various measurements given in the data set.
